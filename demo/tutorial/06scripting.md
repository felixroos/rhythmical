## Harmonic Transforms

### Scale

Instead of using absolute notes, you can use scale + numbers:

<button id="example-scale">Load Example</button>

The numbers refer to steps of the scale (index + 1).

TBD: seperate index/step/degree transforms

### Transpose

You can transpose by a number of semitones:

<button id="example-transpose">Load Example</button>

If using scale and transpose together, you can transpose inside the scale:

<button id="example-transposeScale">Load Example</button>

The example will transpose each number by one, which results in D dorian, which is C major played from the second degree.

You can also use negative numbers to transpose down from the root:

<button id="example-scaleFall">Load Example</button>

## Scripting

### Variables

Using the "let" property you can set variables for easy reuse, accessed with #variableName:

<button id="example-bruderjakob">Load Example</button>

### Assign

You can set property values on children:

<button id="example-bebopChords">Load Example</button>
