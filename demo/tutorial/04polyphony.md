## Polyphony Basics

Now enough of those monophonic melodies. It's the 21st century, we got polyphony:

### Polyphonic Voices

<button id="example-funkytownPolyShort">Show Short Example</button>

This Example uses "p" to define two seperate voices that should run in parallel:

- The main melody
- and the bassline

To make sure both "voices" are in the same groove, they need to have an equal duration.

### Polyphonic Chords

We can not only nest melodies with polyphony, but also nest polyphony inside melodies (or both):

#### Chord string notation

To get even more compact, we can use commas as a shorthand notation for chords:

<button id="example-funkytownPolyC">Show Example</button>
<button id="example-funkytownPolyCShort">Show Short Example</button>

#### TBD: Polyphony Groups
